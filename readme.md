## Idea
E-commerce has changed the way people perceive many things today, including tourism and hospitality. Considering the convenience and cost/time saving online hotel booking platforms are becoming increasingly popular among leisure travellers.  This widespread adoption of internet technology creates the need for providing accommodation booking services online for travellers. Online travel agents such as Airbnb provides marketplaces for property owners to rent out their properties, and travellers to search for their desired accommodations. These travel agents gather details of accommodations around the world or sometimes part of the world and make it available on a single platform for travellers. Airbnb serves the role of an intermediary, facilitating the buyer-seller interaction by providing a secure and trusted platform.
